    This class is responsible for providing utilities for accessing 
    test data, the ones stored in the /data folder.  There is a global singleton instance 
    called 'WTF_DATA_MANAGER' that you can use.

    The idea of having a DataManager class is so you can remove hard coded references to your 
    data files.  This allows other people who have a copy of your project in a different location 
    to be able to run your tests just as easily.

    Instead of::

        open("/usr/local/mickey/MyProject/data/testdata.csv")

    We can reference it without using path information that's specific to where you have your project located.::

        open(WTF_DATA_MANAGER.get_data_path('testdata.csv')

    This will look for the 'testdata.csv' file relative to YourProject/data folder.
