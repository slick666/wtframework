    Test can extend this basetest to add additional unit test functionality such as 
    take screenshot on failure.

    Example::

        from wtframework.wtf.testobjects.basetests import WTFBaseTest
        from wtframework.wtf.web.webdriver import WTF_WEBDRIVER_MANAGER

        class TestScreenCaptureOnFail(WTFBaseTest):
            """"
            These test cases are expected to fail.  They are here to test 
            the screen capture on failure.
            """

            # Comment out decorator to manually test the screen capture.
            @unittest.expectedFailure
            def test_fail(self):
                driver = WTF_WEBDRIVER_MANAGER.new_driver()
                driver.get('http://www.google.com')
                self.fail()
                #Check your /screenshots folder for a screenshot of Google Homepage.


    For the screen capture to work, you need to make sure you use WTF_WEBDRIVER_MANAGER for 
    getting your webdriver instance. This is used for getting the current instance of webdriver 
    when a test fails in order to take a screenshot.

    WTFBaseTest is also an instance of WatchedTestCase, which you can use to add additional 
    call backs you wish to use for handling errors or other test events.
