def do_and_ignore(lambda_func):
    """
    Perform the given function, but only log the error that's printed out.
    Use this function to wrap method calls you would normally do in a try/raise 
    block, but do not care about the results.

    Args:
        lambda_func (function) : Lambda function to execute.

    Returns:
        Returns same return as the lambda statement.  Otherwise returns None

    Usage::

        do_and_ignore(lambda: driver.find_element_by_id("logoutButton").click())

    is equivalent to::

        try:
            driver.find_element_by_id("logoutButton").click()
        except Exception as e:
            print e

    This function is useful for wrapping cleanup calls, since it'll ignore any errors 
    and keeps the test moving along.
